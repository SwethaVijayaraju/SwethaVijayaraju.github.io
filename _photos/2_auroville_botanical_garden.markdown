* The Auroville Botanical Garden was started on 50 acres of old cashew land rescued from the threat of real estate development.
* The site has been transformed into a  luxuriant landscape that serves as an area for research into environmentally sustainable approaches and environmental education.
* More than 310 species have been planted in the 25-acre arboretum, 5,500 specimens have been planted in the 10-acre conservation forest, and a TDEF plant nursery has been created, capable of producing 50,000 seedlings per year to promote the re-introduction of the indigenous flora of the region.
* Conservation and preservation of the Tropical Dry Evergreen Forest (TDEF) is the Botanical Gardenâ€™s special mission.
* Teams of green workers involved in the reforestation work of Auroville have been making trips to sacred groves to collect seeds of the native TDEF species.
* A recent survey done by the Botanical Garden has shown that sacred groves are still rapidly shrinking in size and encroachment is rampant.
* Fortunately, with Auroville now having all the native TDEF species, seed collection happens within Auroville itself.
