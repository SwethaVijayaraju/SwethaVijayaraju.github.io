* The 4 storied mosque has a history of more than 650 years.
* Nakhooda Mishkal, an Arab trader constructed this huge mosque using timber.
* Before the Portuguese attack in 1510 it was 5 storied.
* This mosque is an example of the communal harmony because the Zamorin of Kozhikode donated wood to repair the damage following the Portuguese attack.
* There are 47 doors and just 24 pillars that support the entire structure.
* Important Mughal features like copulas and minarets are not seen in this mosque.
* Influence of temple architecture is seen in the intimate carvings and gopuram- style arches.
* Kuttichira pond is seen attached to the mosque.
* This pond is 250 years old and was formed while taking up soil for the construction of this mosque.
* The extensive use of timber, higher stories and regional architecture of the mosque are seen as some remarkable features.
